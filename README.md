# Restful API backend for a Recipe app.

* Built in **Java** with **Maven** and the **Spring Framework** using a MVC architecture.
* Using **Spring Data JPA** for persisting data into a **MySQL** database.

### What the app will do:
- Users will be able to add their own recipes (with ingredients & instructions, later photos)
- They will be able to search through all recipes (including ones from other users) and save them for later
- The app will be able to recommend new recipes based on their preferences (with similar ingredients)
- Eventually it will be able to pull data from Spoonacular API for better recommendations


### Plans for the future: 
  * Secure the application using Spring Security
  * Use Lombok to get rid of some boilerplate code
  * Make a UI with React (+ maybe React Native for IOS/Android development)

>More details will be added as I build the app
